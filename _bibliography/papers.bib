  abstract = {During bacterial endospore formation, the developing spore is internalized into the mother cell through a phagocytic-like process called engulfment, which involves synthesis and hydrolysis of peptidoglycan. Engulfment peptidoglycan hydrolysis requires the widely conserved and well-characterized DMP complex, composed of SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP. In contrast, although peptidoglycan synthesis has been implicated in engulfment, the protein players involved are less well defined. The widely conserved SpoIIIAH-SpoIIQ interaction is also required for engulfment efficiency, functioning like a ratchet to promote membrane migration around the forespore. Here, we screened for additional factors required for engulfment using transposon sequencing in Bacillus subtilis mutants with mild engulfment defects. We discovered that YrvJ, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, and the MurA paralog MurAB, involved in peptidoglycan precursor synthesis, are required for efficient engulfment. Cytological analyses suggest that both factors are important for engulfment when the DMP complex is compromised and that MurAB is additionally required when the SpoIIIAH-SpoIIQ ratchet is abolished. Interestingly, despite the importance of MurAB for sporulation in B. subtilis, phylogenetic analyses of MurA paralogs indicate that there is no correlation between sporulation and the number of MurA paralogs and further reveal the existence of a third MurA paralog, MurAC, within the Firmicutes. Collectively, our studies identify two new factors that are required for efficient envelop remodeling during sporulation and highlight the importance of peptidoglycan precursor synthesis for efficient engulfment in B. subtilis and likely other endospore-forming bacteria.},

  abstract = {During growth, bacteria remodel and recycle their peptidoglycan (PG). A key family of PG-degrading enzymes is the lytic transglycosylases, which produce anhydromuropeptides, a modification that caps the PG chains and contributes to bacterial virulence. Previously, it was reported that the polar-growing Gram-negative plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens lacks anhydromuropeptides. Here, we report the identification of an enzyme, MdaA (MurNAc deacetylase A), which specifically removes the acetyl group from anhydromuropeptide chain termini in A.~tumefaciens, resolving this apparent anomaly. A.~tumefaciens lacking MdaA accumulates canonical anhydromuropeptides, whereas MdaA was able to deacetylate anhydro-N-acetyl muramic acid in purified sacculi that lack this modification. As for other PG deacetylases, MdaA belongs to the CE4 family of carbohydrate esterases but harbors an unusual Cys residue in its active site. MdaA is conserved in other polar-growing bacteria, suggesting a possible link between PG chain terminus deacetylation and polar growth.},

If released into the extracellular environment, cell wall fragments can trigger inflammation by the immune system of a host. Gastrointestinal bacteria, like Escherichia coli, have dedicated pathways to recycle almost all cell wall fragments they produce. E. coli contains two known recycling transporters, AmpG and Opp, that we previously showed are optimized for growth in different environments. Here, we identify that a third transporter, CadB, can also contribute to cell wall recycling. This work expands our understanding of cell wall recycling and highlights the dedication of organisms like E. coli to ensure high recycling in multiple growth environments.},

  abstract = {Bacteria produce a structural layer of peptidoglycan (PG) that enforces cell shape, resists turgor pressure, and protects the cell. As bacteria grow and divide, the existing layer of PG is remodeled and PG fragments are released. Enterics such as               Escherichia coli               go to great lengths to internalize and reutilize PG fragments.               E. coli               is estimated to break down one-third of its cell wall, yet only loses {\textasciitilde}0 to 5\% of meso-diaminopimelic acid, a PG-specific amino acid, per generation. Two transporters were identified early on to possibly be the primary permease that facilitates PG fragment recycling, i) AmpG and ii) the Opp ATP binding cassette transporter in conjunction with a PG-specific periplasmic binding protein, MppA. The contribution of each transporter to PG recycling has been debated. Here, we have found that AmpG and MppA/Opp are differentially regulated by carbon source and growth phase. In addition, MppA/Opp is uniquely capable of high-affinity scavenging of muropeptides from growth media, demonstrating that AmpG and MppA/Opp allow for different strategies of recycling PG fragments. Altogether, this work clarifies environmental contexts under which               E. coli               utilizes distinct permeases for PG recycling and explores how scavenging by MppA/Opp could be beneficial in mixed communities.},
