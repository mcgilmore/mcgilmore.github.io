  abstract = {Peptidoglycan (PG), a mesh-like structure which is the primary component of the bacterial cell wall, is crucial to maintain cell integrity and shape. While most bacteria rely on penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) for crosslinking, some species also employ LD-transpeptidases (LDTs). Unlike PBPs, the essentiality and biological functions of LDTs remain largely unclear. The Hyphomicrobiales order of the Alphaproteobacteria, known for their polar growth, have PG which is unusually rich in LD-crosslinks, suggesting that LDTs may play a more significant role in PG synthesis in these bacteria. Here, we investigated LDTs in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens and found that LD-transpeptidation, resulting from at least one of 14 putative LDTs present in this bacterium, is essential for its survival. Notably, a mutant lacking a distinctive group of 7 LDTs which are broadly conserved among the Hyphomicrobiales exhibited reduced LD-crosslinking and tethering of PG to outer membrane {$\beta$}-barrel proteins. Consequently, this mutant suffered severe fitness loss and cell shape rounding, underscoring the critical role played by these Hyphomicrobiales-specific LDTs in maintaining cell wall integrity and promoting elongation. Tn-sequencing screens further revealed non-redundant functions for A. tumefaciens LDTs. Specifically, Hyphomicrobiales-specific LDTs exhibited synthetic genetic interactions with division and cell cycle proteins, and a single LDT from another group. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that strains lacking all LDTs except one displayed distinctive phenotypic profiles and genetic interactions. Collectively, our work emphasizes the critical role of LD-crosslinking in A. tumefaciens cell wall integrity and growth and provides insights into the functional specialization of these crosslinking activities.},

  abstract = {During bacterial endospore formation, the developing spore is internalized into the mother cell through a phagocytic-like process called engulfment, which involves synthesis and hydrolysis of peptidoglycan. Engulfment peptidoglycan hydrolysis requires the widely conserved and well-characterized DMP complex, composed of SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP. In contrast, although peptidoglycan synthesis has been implicated in engulfment, the protein players involved are less well defined. The widely conserved SpoIIIAH-SpoIIQ interaction is also required for engulfment efficiency, functioning like a ratchet to promote membrane migration around the forespore. Here, we screened for additional factors required for engulfment using transposon sequencing in Bacillus subtilis mutants with mild engulfment defects. We discovered that YrvJ, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, and the MurA paralog MurAB, involved in peptidoglycan precursor synthesis, are required for efficient engulfment. Cytological analyses suggest that both factors are important for engulfment when the DMP complex is compromised and that MurAB is additionally required when the SpoIIIAH-SpoIIQ ratchet is abolished. Interestingly, despite the importance of MurAB for sporulation in B. subtilis, phylogenetic analyses of MurA paralogs indicate that there is no correlation between sporulation and the number of MurA paralogs and further reveal the existence of a third MurA paralog, MurAC, within the Firmicutes. Collectively, our studies identify two new factors that are required for efficient envelop remodeling during sporulation and highlight the importance of peptidoglycan precursor synthesis for efficient engulfment in B. subtilis and likely other endospore-forming bacteria.},

  abstract = {Bacillus subtilis spores are produced inside the cytosol of a mother cell. Spore surface assembly requires the SpoVK protein in the mother cell, but its function is unknown. Here, we report that SpoVK is a sporulation-specific, forespore-localized putative chaperone from a distinct higher-order clade of AAA+ ATPases that promotes the peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase activity of MurG during sporulation, even though MurG does not normally require activation during vegetative growth. MurG redeploys to the forespore surface during sporulation, where we show that the local pH is reduced and propose that this change in cytosolic nanoenvironment abrogates MurG function. Further, we show that SpoVK participates in a developmental checkpoint in which improper spore surface assembly mis-localizes SpoVK, which leads to sporulation arrest. The AAA+ ATPase clade containing SpoVK includes specialized chaperones involved in secretion, cell envelope biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting that such fine-tuning might be a widespread feature of different subcellular nanoenvironments.},

  abstract = {During growth, bacteria remodel and recycle their peptidoglycan (PG). A key family of PG-degrading enzymes is the lytic transglycosylases, which produce anhydromuropeptides, a modification that caps the PG chains and contributes to bacterial virulence. Previously, it was reported that the polar-growing Gram-negative plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens lacks anhydromuropeptides. Here, we report the identification of an enzyme, MdaA (MurNAc deacetylase A), which specifically removes the acetyl group from anhydromuropeptide chain termini in A.~tumefaciens, resolving this apparent anomaly. A.~tumefaciens lacking MdaA accumulates canonical anhydromuropeptides, whereas MdaA was able to deacetylate anhydro-N-acetyl muramic acid in purified sacculi that lack this modification. As for other PG deacetylases, MdaA belongs to the CE4 family of carbohydrate esterases but harbors an unusual Cys residue in its active site. MdaA is conserved in other polar-growing bacteria, suggesting a possible link between PG chain terminus deacetylation and polar growth.},

  abstract = {During growth and division, the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) is remodelled, resulting in the liberation of PG muropeptides which are typically reinternalized and recycled. Bacteria belonging to the Rhizobiales and Rhodobacterales orders of the Alphaproteobacteria lack the muropeptide transporter AmpG, despite having other key PG recycling enzymes. Here, we show that an alternative transporter, YejBEF-YepA, takes over this role in the Rhizobiales phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Muropeptide import by YejBEF-YepA governs expression of the β-lactamase AmpC in A. tumefaciens, contributing to β-lactam resistance. However, we show that the absence of YejBEF-YepA causes severe cell wall defects that go far beyond lowered AmpC activity. Thus, contrary to previously established Gram-negative models, PG recycling is vital for cell wall integrity in A. tumefaciens. YepA is widespread in the Rhizobiales and Rhodobacterales, suggesting that YejBEF-YepA-mediated PG recycling could represent an important but overlooked aspect of cell wall biology in these bacteria.},

As bacteria grow and divide, the existing layer of PG is remodeled and PG fragments are released. Enterics such as               Escherichia coli               go to great lengths to internalize and reutilize PG fragments.               E. coli               is estimated to break down one-third of its cell wall, yet only loses {\textasciitilde}0 to 5\% of meso-diaminopimelic acid, a PG-specific amino acid, per generation. Two transporters were identified early on to possibly be the primary permease that facilitates PG fragment recycling, i) AmpG and ii) the Opp ATP binding cassette transporter in conjunction with a PG-specific periplasmic binding protein, MppA. The contribution of each transporter to PG recycling has been debated. Here, we have found that AmpG and MppA/Opp are differentially regulated by carbon source and growth phase. In addition, MppA/Opp is uniquely capable of high-affinity scavenging of muropeptides from growth media, demonstrating that AmpG and MppA/Opp allow for different strategies of recycling PG fragments. Altogether, this work clarifies environmental contexts under which               E. coli               utilizes distinct permeases for PG recycling and explores how scavenging by MppA/Opp could be beneficial in mixed communities.},

	abstract = {Background The Enterobacter cloacae complex (Ecc) encompasses opportunistic Gram-negative bacteria demonstrating considerable phenotypic and genotypic diversity. Bloodstream, respiratory and urinary tract infections by Ecc bacteria are associated with morbidity and mortality worldwide. These infections are often difficult to treat since Ecc bacteria are resistant to penicillins, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and third-generation cephalosporins. Resistance also extends to carbapenems, leaving only polymyxins, such as colistin, as a last resort antibiotic for treatment. However, colistin resistance in Ecc isolates is also unexpectedly frequent. Despite extensive information on antibiotic resistance by Enterobacter species, much less is known about their infection biology. There are few reports on the survival and persistence of selected Enterobacter species in macrophages and epithelial cells, but how Enterobacter isolates interact with innate immune host cells upon engulfment remains unexplored. In this study, we have investigated the intracellular trafficking of a subset of antimicrobial resistant Ecc clinical isolates, including colistin-resistant strains, within human macrophages, and determined the macrophage response to the intracellular infection. Methods Phagocytosis of 11 clinical Ecc isolates, including E. cloacae, E. bugandensis, E. kobei, E. xiangfangensis, E. roggenkampii, E. hoffmannii, and E. ludwigii was investigated in THP-1 and human monocyte derived macrophages (HMDMs). Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to ascertain intracellular trafficking via co-localisation of cell markers with fluorescent bacteria. Intracellular bacterial replication was assessed by bacterial enumeration in cell lysates after killing extracellular bacteria and by a fluorescence dilution approach to follow the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall over time. Macrophage cell cytotoxicity was investigated by quantifying the release of lactate dehydrogenase during infection with all isolates. Two prototypic isolates, the E. cloacae ATCC13047 type strain and the E. bugandensis 104107, were used to explore in more detail the response of macrophages to the intracellular infection by determining cleavage of the proinflammatory markers caspase-1, gasdermin D and pro-interleukin-1β. Findings We found that Ecc isolates do not replicate in human macrophages but survive within a modified late phagolysosome compartment. Survival occurred in all species investigated and did not correlate with colistin resistance, lipopolysaccharide modifications, or bacterial pathogenicity in the Galleria mellonella infection model. All isolates induced macrophage cell cytotoxicity at significantly lower levels than controls treated with lipopolysaccharide and nigericin treatment (to induce a proinflammatory response). Low cytotoxicity also correlated with absence of cleavage of proinflammatory markers in infected macrophages. Interpretation Ecc species can survive without replication inside human macrophages with minimal effects on cell viability and inflammation. These observations could have implications in the clinical outcome of patients that cannot readily clear infecting Ecc bacteria. This can potentially lead to prolonged intracellular survival and infection relapse.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
